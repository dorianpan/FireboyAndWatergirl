Project Description: 
	This project is called “fireboy and watergirl v.112”. The game is based on the online game “Fireboy and Watergirl”, 
which is essentially a game where players control characters, get over obstacles, and get to the destination, 
but with more or different features added onto the original game, and with a new mode: “maze mode” added.

How to run the file:
	There are six files in total, but you can just run the whole program in the Main function file, which has the name “MainFunction” on it.

Python libraries:
	There are six files in total, with five files containing helper functions and classes, and the main file containing the main body MVC. 
	No external module used, just cmu 112 graphics.

Shortcuts:
	Available shortcuts are indicated inside the game canvas.
